# 🏥 Medical-Blockchain-Implementation

A beginner-friendly blockchain implementation in **Python** for securely storing medical records.  
This project demonstrates how blockchain concepts can be applied in **healthcare**, ensuring **tamper-proof patient history**, **traceability**, and **data integrity**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Genesis block creation** – the first block starts the patient’s medical history.  
- ✅ **Add medical records** – store doctor visits, diagnoses, and prescriptions.  
- ✅ **Patient-wise blockchain** – each patient has their own secure chain of records.  
- ✅ **Trace medical history** – fetch complete records step by step.  
- ✅ **Tamper-proof verification** – validates if medical history is intact.  
- ✅ **Interactive CLI menu** – add new records and view patient history easily.  
- ✅ **Beginner-friendly Python code** – demonstrates blockchain principles without external complexity.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. A new patient starts with a **Genesis block** (beginning of their medical history).  
2. Each doctor’s visit (**diagnosis + prescription**) is stored as a **block**.  
3. Blocks are linked using **SHA-256 hashing**, ensuring they cannot be altered.  
4. When the patient visits again, a **new block** is added to the chain.  
5. The patient’s **full history** can be traced securely across doctors/hospitals.  
6. **Validation** ensures data has not been tampered.

## 🔑 Concepts Used

- 🧱 **Blockchain basics** – linked blocks storing patient data  
- 🔒 **SHA-256 hashing** – ensures medical records are secure  
- ✨ **Immutability** – past medical records cannot be changed  
- 📜 **Traceability** – complete patient history in chronological order  
- ✅ **Data validation** – blockchain integrity check for tamper detection
